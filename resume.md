<h1>My Github Repositories</h1>

<h2><u><a href="https://github.com/janGithub122/JellyMarioBot" target="_blank">Jelly Mario Bot</a></u></h2>

This was my first github repository, a very simple python script that automatically moves mario in a browser game. It's not much, but it was a simple idea that I wanted to create for a little coding practice.


<h2><u><a href="https://github.com/janGithub122/AudioChatbot" target="_blank">Audio Chatbot</a></u></h2>

In this script I wanted to test out using APIs since I had never used them before. The code contains two seperate APIs, Google Speech Recognition and HuggingChat. What the script actually does is that it records a message from the user using their mic, converts that audio into text using Google Speech Recognition, sends it an AI chatbot (HuggingChat) as a prompt, and finally the AI's response is converted to text-to-speech to simulate an actual conversation.
