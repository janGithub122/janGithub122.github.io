<h1>Work In Progress Projects</h1>

<h2><u>AI Speech API Tool</u></h2>
This goal of this project is to create a chat bot that you have to talk to using your mic, and I want to do it using only free apis, as I've seen another project like this before but it was using 3 different paid apis. Currently what I have done for the project is create a speech-to-text function in order to be able to send the message to whatever chat bot API I end up using. My end goal for the project is to have the bot talk back using somesort of text-to-speech in order for the conversation to feel just a little bit natural.<br>

<h3>Update #1</h3>
In the current state of the project, you can talk to the HuggingChat AI using your only your mic, and it will respond back to you in text-to-speech using gTTs. This was the original goal of the project, but now after creating it I have had new ideas that I want to try and implement. There are two specific ones I want to try which is to speed up the text-to-speech as it is quite slow, and I want to give the chat bot a starting prompt without having to print it's response, which has been a little bit harder than I thought to do.

<h3>Update #2</h3>
The project has been uploaded to github which you can check out <u><a href="https://github.com/janGithub122/AudioChatbot" target="_blank">here</a></u>. Currently I've added a way to configure the TTS' speed, but I'm yet to add a pitch configuration, so hopefully I can get that done soon.
