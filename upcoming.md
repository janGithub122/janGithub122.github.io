<h1>Work In Progress Projects</h1>

<h2><u>AI Speech API Tool</u></h2>
This goal of this project is to create a chat bot that you have to talk to using my mic. Currently what I have done for the project is create a speech-to-voice function in order to be able to send the message to whatever AI chat bot I end up using. My end goal for the project is to have the bot talk back using somesort of text-to-speech in order for the conversation to feel just a little bit natural.
